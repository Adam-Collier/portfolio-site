  A rare glimpse into my top 5 favourite films of all time, regardless of genre.
  Of course, they are subject to change over time as I grow as a human, but
  that's just the way it goes.

Ah film, the wonderful artistic medium that continually breaks down boundaries
and explores the limits of human emotion. Nothing can prepare you for that
moment when a scene or a moment blows you away or makes you feel something
you've never felt before. I felt it important to start to document what I have
come to appreciate the most overtime and this is the first article to sit within
this garden of thought.

<Film cover="little_women_cover" title="Little Women" year="2016" genre="Drama, Romance" rating={5}>

The love and care that is
oozing out of this film are so strong and beautiful you can't stop grinning and
wishing those moments upon yourself. Never before have I experienced something
so pure and honest on the screen that I was enticed into the whirlwind of
emotions that is Little Women. An incredible group of enchanting characters each
trying to own their own story and make something of themselves, unaware of the
sacrifices they will have to endure and the bonds that will break. It is
beautiful, celebratory and exuberant in a way every film should be, Greta Gerwig
outdid herself with this film, and it earned every one of those stars.

<Film
  cover="dark_knight_cover"
  title="The Dark Knight"
  year="2008"
  genre="Drama, Action, Crime, Thriller"
  rating={4.5}
>

You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain." An Exhilarating and riveting 152 minutes of pure joy and everything a superhero film should be. The opening bank robbery scene will forever be one of my favourites and who can forget Heath Ledger's mesmerising performance. Forget a spoon full of sugar, introduce a little anarchy and watch Gotham City come to life.

</Film>

<Film cover="parasite_cover" title="Parasite" year="2019" genre="Comedy, Thriller, Drama" rating={4.5}>

Expectations were already high, but fuck me it's even better than I anticipated. Forget about genres, Parasite flat out refused to fit the narrow parameters of any existing classification. As beautiful and well-executed Parasite is at face value Boon Jong Ho also encourages us to look at the underlying socio-political issues currently being experienced in Korea, honing in on the limited and ignorant perspective of the wealthy. A must-watch for those who want something brilliant have an innate appreciation for minimalist architecture.

<Film cover="victoria_cover" title="Victoria" year="2015" genre="Crime, Thriller, Romance" rating={4.5}>

Filmed in one continuous take and made all the more believable by excellent performances from the cast, Victoria is a triumph in filming processes and work ethic. I read recently that the script for the film only consisted of 12 pages, as it turns out most of the dialogue was improvised by the actors, subconsciously I think we embrace that. The levels of reality become indistinguishable from your own; you live through the characters, experience their moments and feel their emotions. I already loved Berlin as a city and Victoria makes me like it that little bit more.

</Film>

<Film cover="amelie_cover" title="Amelie" year="2001" genre="Crime, Thriller, Romance" rating={4.5}>

Amelie really is the movie equivalent of being hugged. It's a beautifully crafted and exquisitely narrated tale about the simple things in life and succeeds in making us pause to appreciate the small wonders that surround us in the everyday. It is by far one of the most joyous, idiosyncratic and downright fun movies I have ever watched, and I long to find another film that makes me feel this way. I'll admit I'm almost residing to the fact that film may not exist.

<h3>Worthy Contenders</h3>

Any of the below could realistically slip into the top 5 depending on what mood
I'm in but even if you disagree it'll be a good movie you can watch. So in no
particular order:
