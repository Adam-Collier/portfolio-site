## Josh Comeau's CSS in JS

```css
/* useful width options */
width: min-content | max-content | fit-content;

/* inherit colours for parent child consistency */
color: inherit;

/* isolated stacking context (add to the wrapper) */
isolation: isolate;

/* keep items inline */
white-space: nowrap;

/* only add styles for mouse/trackpad users */
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  button:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

#### Recommended break points

- 0-550px — Mobile
- 550-1100px — Tablet
- 1100-1500px — Laptop
- 1500+px — Desktop

#### Using Rems instead of pixels for breakpoints

The idea behind this being, as the user increases their default font size the @media scale slides to accomodate those changes. Whereas, with pixels being "static" our layouts would become cramped and unable to adjust, if the user increased their default font size.

```js
// constants.js
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  tabletMin: 550,
  laptopMin: 1100,
  desktopMin: 1500,
}

const QUERIES = {
  'tabletAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.tabletMin / 16}rem)`
  'laptopAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.laptopMin / 16}rem)`
  'desktopAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.desktopMin / 16}rem)`
}
```
