## CSS

### Responsive CSS grid

Taken from the infamous CSS Tricks post [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/). This serves as a good starting point for setting up your responsive grid.

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  /* This is better for small screens, once min() is better supported */
  /* grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(200px, 100%), 1fr)); */
  grid-gap: 1rem;
  /* This is the standardized property now, but has slightly less support */
  /* gap: 1rem */
}
```

### Full width in restricted container

A useful snippet when you need to break out of some constraints in the page layout e.g a grid of images between some written content that fills the width of the page.

```css
.full-width {
  width: 100vw;
  position: relative;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin-left: -50vw;
  margin-right: -50vw;
}
```

### Max width in restricted container

Too much uniformity in a layout can create for a sub par experience, to create some moments of interest you can break out slightly, but not full width.

```css
.not-full-but-bigger {
  margin: auto calc(50% - 50vw);
  width: 60vw;
  transform: translateX(calc(50vw - 50%));
}
```

### Line Clamp

An essential snippet of code to have in your arsenal. No more CSS hacks or over engineered Javascript solutions needed.

```css
.line-clamp {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Carousel

A CSS only carousel, made possible by the introduction of scroll-snap. If you're wanting chevrons and click to slide functionality stick to a JS library, but for a mobile only carousel it works great.

```css
.carousel {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
  overflow-x: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}

.carousel .item {
  flex-shrink: 0;
  width: 100%;
  scroll-snap-align: center;
}

/* hide horizontal scroll bar Chrome/Safari */
.carousel::-webkit-scrollbar-track,
.carousel::-webkit-scrollbar,
.carousel::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  width: 0 !important;
}

.carousel {
  /* Firefox */
  scrollbar-width: none;
  /* IE */
  ms-overflow-style: none;
}
```

### Background shorthand

Sometimes it can be a pain remembering the order of each background property (it gets me every time).

```css
/* image, position, size and repeat */
body {
  background: url(sweettexture.jpg) top center / 200px 200px no-repeat;
}
```

### Multiple background images

Remember that the icon/image is declared after the colour. A good use case for this is image placeholders, for example you could have your companys logo above their brand grey.

```css
.image-placeholder {
  background: #eff0f2 url('./icons/logo.svg');
}

/* alternatively we can define colour and image seperately for the same effect */
.image-placeholder {
  background-color: #eff0f2;
  background-image: url('./icons/logo.svg');
}
```

### Underline styles

Although improving, underlining text in CSS doesn't allow for many stylistic customisations (like stroke width or space from the text). The below solution creates a flexible underline which skips any descenders.

```css
li {
  // for the underline to "skip" the descenders
  text-shadow: 1px 1px var(--primary-background), 1px -1px var(--primary-background),
    -1px 1px var(--primary-background), -1px -1px var(--primary-background);
}

.current-menu-item {
  position: relative;
  &:before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 1.5px;
    bottom: 1px;
    background: var(--primary-foreground);
    z-index: -1;
  }
}
```

### Accessible icon text

To make buttons more accessible we need to let screen readers differentiate each buttons intention. By utilising the `visually-hidden` class name we can hide the text (keeping only the icon) and out buttons will be accessible.

```css
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  width: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
}
```

### Using revert instead of underline

Say we have created a link with `text-decoration: none` and we want the underline to show on hover, instead of explicitly saying `text-decoration: underline` we can use `revert` so it falls back to the original "state".

```css
a {
  text-decoration: none;

  &:hover {
    text-decoration: revert;
  }
}
```

### Apply styles if within another component

This is a fairly tricky thing to understand because we normally understand css as only being able to look inward. However, with Styled components we can check whether a styled component exists within another component and change those styles accordingly.

```js
const TextLink = styled.a`
  /* Standard styles: */
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: none;
  /* Styles when rendered inside a quote: */
  ${QuoteContent} & {
    color: black;
    text-decoration: revert;
  }
`;
```

### The Stack layout

Utilising the "Lobotomised Owls" selector we can create more consistent spacing between elements on our pages. Essentially we are telling the browser to only apply margin top to those elements which have a previous sibling.

```css
.stack {
  --space: 1.5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

.stack > * {
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

.stack > * + * {
  margin-top: var(--space);
}
```
