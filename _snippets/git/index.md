## Git

### Delete local branches

When you have merged and deleted a branch on github this command will delete the local branches that dont exist remotely.

```bash
$ git branch -vv | grep 'origin/.*: gone]' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git branch -d
```

### Add something to .gitignore

Refreshes the tracking of your files. Super useful for adding new things to your .gitignore file.

```bash
$ git rm -r --cached .
```

### Git stash

An underrated command in my opinion. Need to quickly switch branch to do something but don't want to commit your changes on the current branch just yet? Git stash is perfect for this.

```bash
# for when it's too hard to think of a message
$ git stash

# to make it clearer what each stash is
$ git stash save "optional message for yourself"

# apply the latest stash (I tend to use this the most)
$ git stash apply stash@{0}

# view a list of your stashes
$ git stash list
```
