### Install Wordpress locally

[Wordpress's officially documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP) is pretty good for this. (I do wish there was a quick and easy CLI solution for this).

### Setting up Virtual Hosts

Go to `MAMP > Preferences > Ports` and set Apache Port to be `80`

Open the hosts file in VS Code:

```bash
$ cd /etc
$ code hosts
```

Add the urls you want to use:

```php
127.0.0.1 your-site.test
```

(you may need to sudo save, VS Code makes this easy for you)

Add the virtual hosts to the end of `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`:

```html
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs" ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName your-site.test DocumentRoot "/Users/username/Sites/directory"
</VirtualHost>
```

(notice how we are re-setting up the main localhost first)

And make sure the NameVirtualHost is set to:

```php
NameVirtualHost *:80
```

Then in `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf`

Uncomment this line:

```php
# Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Find this line:

```html
<Directory />
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>
```

and change it from `None` to `All`:

Lastly find these two instances:

```php
Listen 8888
ServerName localhost:8888
```

and change them to:

```php
Listen 80
ServerName localhost:80
```

and then it should work!

If you find your site feels a little sluggish compared to using localhost you can speed up the lookup time by adding it as an alias. So in `/etc/hosts`:

```php
127.0.0.1 localhost your-site.test
```

### Altering Site Address and Wordpress Address

When switching to virtual hosts from a localhost setup the site address and wordpress address general settings were causing some issues. You may find you can't access the admin, because its setup for a different url, so here's how to fix that.

Open your projects `wp-config.php` file and after the “define” statements (just before the comment line that says “That’s all, stop editing!”), insert a new line:

```php
define('RELOCATE',true)
```

Now if your site is at `http://www.yourdomainname.com` your need to go to `http://www.yourdomainname.com/wp-login.php` (notice how we are manually accessing the wp-login.php file)

Login in as normal and make the changes in `General > Settings`

Make sure to remove `define('RELOCATE',true)` after successfully changing the urls.
