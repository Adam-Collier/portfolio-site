  Sometimes you need a code editor to do code editor stuff. Here's how to add
  one to your React projects.

This post is going to cover how to add Codemirror to a react project. Codemirror
is a versatile code editor implemeted in javascript for the browser. For my
implentation I added it to an electron app built with react but it will work
exactly the same in a standard react install. I could have just added the
react-codemirror package to do this but sometimes I find adding packages can
make things more complicated than they should be.

Okay lets get stuck in!

First we need to npm install codemirror

```bash
$ npm i codemirror
```

Note: I did initially try and just use the codemirror.js file from the
downloadable zip (to try and keep everything a little smaller and concise) but I
ran into a few issues so reverted to using the npm package

and then we can import it into our react file

```js
import CodeMirror from 'codemirror';
```

Now we can create our textarea which will become our code editor

```jsx{4-16}
import React from "react"
import CodeMirror from "codemirror"

function Editor(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        defaultValue={`<style>
  .body{
    background: blue
  }
</style>`}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Editor
```

Then we need to use `useRef` and the `ref` attribute to access the textarea DOM
element. This is needed so we can tell Codemirror what element to turn into a
code editor later on.

```jsx{1,5,10}
import React, { useRef } from "react"
import CodeMirror from "codemirror"

function Editor(props) {
  const editor = useRef(null)

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        ref={editor}
        defaultValue={`<style>
  .body{
    background: blue
  }
</style>`}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Editor
```

Next we need to initialise CodeMirror, and to do that we need to use the
`useEffect` React Hook (you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount,
componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.)

So when our component has mounted and the DOM we can create a CodeMirror editor
instance

```jsx{1,7-14}
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react"
import CodeMirror from "codemirror"

function Editor(props) {
  const editor = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    CodeMirror.fromTextArea(editor.current, {
      lineNumbers: false,
      mode: "htmlmixed",
      theme: "one-dark",
      tabSize: 1,
    })
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea
        ref={editor}
        defaultValue={`<style>
  .body{
    background: blue
  }
</style>`}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Editor
```

And this is the basic setup done! Now I have added some other features which I
will stick below and talk through a little

```jsx{2,4-16,18-25}
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react"
import styled from "styled-components"
import CodeMirror from "codemirror"

import "../lib/CodeMirror/codemirror.css"
import "../lib/CodeMirror/one-dark.css"

import "codemirror/mode/javascript/javascript"
import "codemirror/mode/xml/xml"
import "codemirror/mode/css/css"
import "codemirror/mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed"

import "codemirror/addon/edit/closebrackets"
import "codemirror/addon/edit/closetag"
import "codemirror/addon/search/searchcursor"
import "codemirror/keymap/sublime"

const CodeEditor = styled.div`
  .CodeMirror {
    line-height: 1.4;
  }

  .cm-s-one-dark.CodeMirror,
  textarea {
    padding: 35px 25px 25px 25px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    background: #21252b;
  }
`

function Editor(props) {
  const editor = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    CodeMirror.fromTextArea(editor.current, {
      lineNumbers: false,
      mode: "htmlmixed",
      theme: "one-dark",
      autoCloseBrackets: true,
      autoCloseTags: true,
      tabSize: 1,
      keyMap: "sublime",
    })
  })

  return (
    <CodeEditor>
      <textarea
        ref={editor}
        defaultValue={`<style>
  .body{
    background: blue
  }
</style>`}
      />
    </CodeEditor>
  )
}

export default Editor
```

So to explain a little, I am using the one dark theme by Török Ádám which can be
found [here](https://github.com/Aerobird98/codemirror-one-dark-theme), created a
file within `src` and imported it. Then I have added the theme name to the
Codemirror instance options and so it knows what styles to use.

The code that will be written in the editor will be a mix of css, html and
javascript therefore I am using `htmlmixed` mode. There are a bunch of other
options you can use such as just `javascript`, `css` and `xml` (for HTML) just
take a look at the CodeMirror docs to find the one relevant for your project.

Because I'm using `htmlmixed` I need to import the javascript, xml, css and
htmlmixed js files from codemirrors mode directory for it to work correctly (the
imports will differ depending on the mode you're using). This was the biggest
pain point for me and it took me a bit of time to figure it out.

And lastly I'm importing and declaring some addons which will add some useful
features to the editor. See `autoCloseBrackets: true`, `autoCloseTags: true` and
`keyMap: "sublime"` options have been added to the CodeMirror instance as well
as importing the files.

One important thing to notice is that the `one-dark.css` was the only extra file
needed, all of the addons and syntax highlighting was imported directly from the
codemirror dependency. By not adding a `./` or `../` before the import your js
files are presumed to live in your node_modules.

Hope you have enjoyed this post and have a go setting up your own CodeMirror
instance in React!
