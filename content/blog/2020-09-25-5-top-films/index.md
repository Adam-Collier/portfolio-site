Oh film, the wondrous man made creation that constantly breaks down boundaries and explores the limits of human emotion how I love thee. Those of you that know me will know that I love everything film, I think it's one of humankinds greatest achievements and is pioneered by some exceptional people, serving us up an absolute feast for our eyes. I find it difficult to pin point the "wow" moments in my life but I know a lot of them are rooted in film and losing myself in completely different narratives.

I felt it important to start to document what I have appreciated the most over time and this is the first one to sit within this space. As well as my top 5 I will also add some worthy contenders below because in all honesty on another day they could easily fall within my top 5.

<Film cover="./covers/little_women_cover.jpg" title="Little Women" year="2016" genre="Drama, Romance" rating={5}>

I only watched this recently and I thought it was magnificent. Never before have I become so attached to a group of characters, their dynamic being something anyone could only wish for. I remember watching Greta Gerwig in Frances Ha (by Noah Baumbach) and I honestly think she is an incredible writer and director. She created settings and emotional attachements that I've never experienced in any other film.

<Film cover="./covers/dark_knight_cover.jpg" title="The Dark Knight" year="2008" genre="Drama, Action, Crime, Thriller" rating={4.5}>

Apart from a stellar performance from Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace) and a solid plot I think this has to have one of my favourite opening of any film. It doesnt hesitate to jump straight into the exciting world of Gotham City and set the premise for the whole film. The improvised hospital scene holds a special place in my heart and has got to be one of the most perfect unscripted moments I've experienced in a film, every time I see it I can't help but sit there in total satisfaction.

<Film cover="./covers/parasite_cover.jpg" title="Parasite" year="2019" genre="Comedy, Thriller, Drama" rating={4.5}>

I have watched a few Korean films now (notably Memories of a murder, the Curse and I saw the Devil) and as good as they were they don't quite match Parasite's brilliance. The complexity of the characters, the beautifully sculpted dialogue and the playfullness of the plot is an extremely difficult thing to balance but this film does just that.

<Film cover="./covers/victoria_cover.jpg" title="Victoria" year="2015" genre="Crime, Thriller, Romance" rating={4.5}>

If this film doesn't give you that "wow" moment I think any film will struggle to. I was completely blown away that it was all filmed in one shot, I found out beforehand that this was the case and focussed ever so more on calling it out as a fake. But low and behold it stands true in all its magnificence.
</Film>

<Film cover="./covers/amelie_cover.jpg" title="Amelie" year="2015" genre="Crime, Thriller, Romance" rating={4.5}>

![Amelie Screenshot](./images/amelie.jpg)
Amelie is one of those films that once you've watched it for the first time you will never experience that same feeling again (I have been searching for it ever since). Amelie has got to be one of the most likeable characters every created in the cine-verse and the whole films encapsulated narrative, humour and romance stunningly well.
