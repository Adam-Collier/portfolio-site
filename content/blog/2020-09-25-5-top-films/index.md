This week I had my first play around with Gutenberg blocks and created my first block (it was a wild ride...). In this post, I thought I would give a little insight into the process of creating a block and some of the headaches I experienced along the way. One important thing to note is that none of this would have been possible without all of the hard work put into the `create-guten-block` open source project so a big thanks to those guys. Okay, now the small talk is over with lets jump right in.
