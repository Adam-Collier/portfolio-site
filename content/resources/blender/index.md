## Courses

[Polygon Runway](https://polygonrunway.com) - Watch/Learn - I stumbled across
this course via a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/killnicole/status/1313511612142288896) from
[@killnicole](https://twitter.com/killnicole), which I am forever greatful for.
I've wanted to learn how to create 3D work for a very long time but never known
how to get started. I'm coming to the end of the course now and I can't
recommend it enough.
