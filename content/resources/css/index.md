Breaking this word up into smaller parts, lets start with the phase 'Style Sheets'.

**Style Sheets:** During the earlier days of the internet, HTML only allowed for very little style of it's web pages, and only allowed for inline styling, written within the same file. Nowadays, these style sheets, are files that segregated from HTML files, and can be easily added anytime.

**Cascading:** This word represents how the styles are organised, when both styles for the same selector is made, the latest change to that style will be the one most prominant - the one that actually gets used.
