Everything design-related I find useful and will reference in the future. It also lets me keep my sanity by not scouring the whole web for an article I saw once.

## Subscribe worthy newsletters

[Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com/) - Inspirational/Critical Thinking - I look forward to [@KaiBrach](https://twitter.com/kaibrach)'s newsletter each week and it never fails to inspire or have some sort of impression on my day. Well worth a subscribe.

[Spotify Design](https://spotify.design/) - Product Design - These guys write some great articles about product design. They also have some playlists you can listen to whilst designing (which is always a bonus).

[Fresh Fonts](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/freshfonts) - For the Font Lovers - Ever wanted to see the latest and best from Type design? [@noemistauffer](https://twitter.com/noemistauffer) always puts together something magical. She even has a section dedicated to free fonts, which I always appreciate.

[It's Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/newsletters) - The Don of Design News - It's Nice That has been my go-to for design news and inspiration for years. I have the odd scroll now and then but their weekly email always adds some quality to my inbox.

[Sidebar](https://sidebar.io/) - 5 links a day - A long time favourite of mine and Sidebar never scuppers on sending quality content. I'll admit sometimes 5 links can be a little overwhelming to check daily in that case I recommend just going on the site every now and then, you won't be disappointed.

## Interview collections

[Staff Design](https://staff.design) - The Individual Contributor Path - I'm a massive fan of anything Brian Lovin does and this is no exception. Brian interviews a great collection of designers and gets some great insights into career growth and the Individual Contributor Path.

[Lovers Magazine](https://www.loversmagazine.com/) - Essential Designer Questions - Previously Interface Lovers, Lovers Magazine amplifies the voice of the designer. Asking the essential questions every designer wants to know in order to push and inspire themselves and creatives in the community.

## Tools

[The Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) - Theory/Thinking - A superb site explaining a collection of design principles that designers can consider when designing a user interface. It's also a stunning website...

[Savee](https://savee.it/) - Collect Inspiration - Like Pinterest but much MUCH better. The content you can source and stumble upon here is much better quality than pretty much anything out there. It's better for graphic design but all inspiration is good inspiration, right?

[Growth Design](https://growth.design/case-studies/) - Product/Real World - A product designer essential. Each case study dissects the apps user journey/experience and gets into the nitty-gritty of what works and what doesn't, but also how it can be improved (which is the part I enjoy the most).

[Miro](https://miro.com) - Collaboration/Sprints - An amazing tool for facilitating design sprints and collaborating with others. You know a product is good when you think less about how to use it and more about creating quality products.

[Whiteboard](https://witeboard.com/) - Whiteboard with Friends - A great tool if you ever need to quickly sketch and talk through ideas will colleagues or friends. Simply share a URL and away you go.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com) - Collaboration/Design - In my opinion THE best design tool out there right now. Collaborate with other designer friends, work up prototypes for design sprints and share your work easily with developers. It's pretty much a life saver!

## Articles

[Space, Grids, and Layouts](https://www.designsystems.com/space-grids-and-layouts/) - Design Systems - My go-to article when thinking about layouts and initial setup. A huge helper in defining spacing and starting to understand the fundamentals.

[A Complete Guide to Typography](https://www.designsystems.com/iconography-guide/) - Design Systems - Essential reading when starting on your iconography journey. Again getting that initial setup makes all the difference in making your icons consistent and beautiful to look at.

[Icons & Keylines Demystified](https://medium.com/@minoraxis/icon-grids-keylines-demystified-5a228fe08cfd) - Icon Design - A great introduction to the different approaches you can take to your guide setup to create consistent icons. I tend to go for the Material design approach but it's whatever works for you.

## Figma

My design tool of choice and great for designing collaboratively, prototyping and sharing previews. The Figma team are revolutionising design tooling and taking it to another level.

### The best time saving tip (apple users only sorry)

Need to quickly take a screenshot on your IPhone and paste it in to Figma? A great tip I found takes advantage of Apple's [handoff feature](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209455). Once handoff is activated on your Mac and IPhone you can grab your phone > take a screenshot > tap share > hit copy and then on your desktop just paste it straight into Figma! It's saved me tonnes of time and now the wisdom is passed to you.

### Useful Plugins

[Instance Finder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741895659787979282) - Component Management - Finding and trimming down your unused components can be a daunting task, this plugin makes it a tonne easier. Have confidence that your components aren't being used anywhere.

[Lorem Ipsum](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736000994034548392/Lorem-ipsum) - Generate Dummy Text - As designers we always need to quickly add some dummy text, this handles that for you. The Auto-generate feature is also a nice touch and saves a lot of time.

## Icons

[CSS.gg Icon Set](https://css.gg/) - A Solid Set of Icons - A thorough collection of open source icons you can use in any of your projects. Created by [@AstritMalsija](https://twitter.com/astritmalsija) it's a great set to have in your arsenal as a designer and/or a developer.
