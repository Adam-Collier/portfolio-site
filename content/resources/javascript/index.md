### **ES6**

Learn ES6 the Dope Way.

ES6 short for (ECMAScript 6, more fondly known as ECMAScript 2015 - was released that year). Lets again, break this up.

ECMAScript is the standard implementation of what is widely known as JavaScript, however the name JavaScript came from it's inventor Brendan Eich.

When his boss asked him one day to create a language for it, using some of the object orientated implementation of the language hot at the time (1995) 'Java'.

However the official name of the new standard of this langauge is called ECMAScript; the new naming is derived from a long arduous history of the language's inception, and corporate war between Microsoft's JScript and NetScape's JavaScript language standards

Not going to go into any more depth, the story to take from this is that having 2 or more competiting standards for a technology is usually bad for industry.
