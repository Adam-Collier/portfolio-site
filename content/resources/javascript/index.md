## Subscribe worthy newsletters

[Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) - No Ads, No Bullshit - [@taniarascia](https://twitter.com/taniarascia) has a real gift for making new and potentially confusing concepts simple and easy to understand. This is an essential subscribe (and check out her backlog).

[Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/subscribe/) - He's a Wizard Harry - Because it's Kent Dodds... Joking but also not joking. I reference a lot of Kent's articles all of the time so I can guarantee you will find something you like.

[Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/) - The Fundamentals - [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) is a legend in the React/Javascript community and to top it off he and Maggie Appleton have created this newsletter course to help you understand the fundamentals at a deeper level.

[Josh Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com/) - Site Envy Included - I followed [@JoshWComeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) before I subscribed to his newsletter and everything he puts out there is great. Highly recommended (and try not to envy his site too much).

## Podcasts

[Syntax FM](https://syntax.fm/) - Podcast Royalty - An invaluable podcast hosted by the one and only Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. I switch up my podcasts a lot but I listen to these guys every week without fail.

## Articles

[Higher Order Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) - Watch/Playlist - Fun Fun Function is one of my favourite Youtube channels and I have followed him for a while now. Regardless if you are new to JavaScript or been at it a while Matthias is great at explaining daunting topics through simple examples.

[David Walsh Fetch Api Article](https://davidwalsh.name/fetch) - Read - An article I come back to time and time again when I spontaneously forget how to use the fetch API (it happens a lot).

[Understanding Map and Set](https://www.taniarascia.com/understanding-map-and-set-javascript/) - Read - [@taniarascia](https://twitter.com/taniarascia) has written a great post on the new iterable objects types introduced in ECMAScript 2015. I'm pretty new to Map and Set so this gave me a good understanding of when it could be used.

[How to Modify Nodes in an Abstract Syntax Tree](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-modify-nodes-in-an-abstract-syntax-tree/) - Parsing Markdown - If you've ever created a plugin in Gatsby this might be familiar to you. [@jlengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) talks us through how to create an AST from markdown and how to manipulate what HTML is output.

[How to Set Up webpack 5 from Scratch](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-webpack/) - Webpack fundamentals - I have previously avoided setting up Webpack configs because it's an intimidating feat (relying on create-react-apps built-in config) but, Tania does a great job of explaining the fundamentals in a simple and approachable way. I feel confident that if you took a bit of time to read through the article, you could get your own Webpack project set up in no time.

## Tools

[Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) - NPM module cost - A good sounding board for whether an npm should be installed. If something seems a little large I'll tend to look for something else or build something custom.
