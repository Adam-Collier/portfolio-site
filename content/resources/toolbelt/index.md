Helps developers build applications/websites faster and automate tedious processes. Just makes life a bit easier (which we all like)

## Text Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Firm Favourite - My go to editor of choice. No need for anymore suggestions, it's just that good. I'll also add some of my current config below.

## Dependency Management

What if every everyone released the new version of their modules at the same time, and everyone updated the moment after. Simply put it, never gonna happen.

[Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - A must have - Seemlessly manage your node and npm versions. This has been a life saver on more than one occasion and it makes it all super simple. I have some snippets available which will help you in setting up and not having to scour the docs for relevant commands.

## Cheatsheets

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - Markdown Loveliness - The holy grail of markdown cheat sheets. It's the only one you'll every need (unless you're venturing down the MDX path)

### Task Runners

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Automate Tasks - A simple, easy to learn task runner, producing efficient builds, automate task. It's super flexible and the only one I tend to use (especially for Wordpress development).

## Collaboration

[MakeSpace](https://makespace.fun) - Collaboration/Create - A whole new way to collaborate, apart. A place to co-create, co-work, or just hang out. It's still relatively early in it's development but I think it has a whole load of potential.

[Notion](https://www.notion.so) - Collaboration/Notes - Write, plan, collaborate, and get organized. A really great tool for note taking and prepping/recording meeting notes. Now it's free for personal accounts!

## Sharing
[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) - Share Code Images - Create and share beautiful images of your source code. Images can easily be shared to twitter or you can download the images files and share that way.

## Thinking

[Untools](https://untools.co/) - Thinking/Learning - A collection of thinking tools and frameworks to help you solve problems, make decisions and understand systems. I've not read a lot of it yet but it seems pretty cool.
