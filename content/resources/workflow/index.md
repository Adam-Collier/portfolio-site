This of course will cover a lot of ground but it will mainly focus on any tips or tools which I think improve productivity or workflow.

## Spotlight overhaul

[Raycast](https://raycast.com/) - Spotlight but better - I came across Raycast via a [tweet from @mxstbr](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1395274968703832064) and I've got to say it's pretty amazing and improved my productivity and overall workflow tremendously. Quick Links is an amazing feature and I can open code projects quicker than ever!

## Music

[LoFi Cafe](https://www.lofi.cafe/) - The best of LoFi - Discovered in [@KaiBrach's](https://twitter.com/KaiBrach) [Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com/) issue #139 and I love everything about it: a great aesthetic, a curated selection of channels and shortcuts for easy control.

## Window Management

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - Spectacle but better - Moving to a widescreen monitor meant I needed to focus a lot more on my window management. It's pretty much Spectacle (RIP Spectacle) but better, written in Swift means it's super quick and you can tweak all of the shortcuts to your preferences.

## Sharing files

[Wormhole](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Share files flawlessly - I like to think of it as weTransfer without the fuss. Forget waiting files to finish uploading to send out the link, share it straight away and let friends/colleagues start downloading simultaneously.

[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net/) - Airdrop alternative - Sometimes I find airdrop to be a little temperamental so this neat little site lets you share files between devices if you are on the same network.
