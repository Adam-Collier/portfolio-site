This of course will cover a lot of ground but I will mainly focus on any tips or tools which I think improve productivity or workflow be it between apps or between people.

## Sharing files

[Wormhole](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Share files flawlessly - I like to think of it as weTransfer without the fuss. Forget waiting files to finish uploading to send out the link, share it straight away and let friends/colleagues start downloading simultaneously.

[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net/) - Airdrop alternative - Sometimes I find airdrop to be a little temperamental so this neat little site lets you share files between devices if you are on the same network.
