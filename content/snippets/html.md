### Details element for HTML accordion

An HTML first "accordian". Forget about using Javascript and make it simple for yourself by utilising semantic HTML. You can also style the default arrow by targeting the `:marker` pseudo element.

```html
<details>
  <summary>What?</summary>
  Stay Home Stay Safe!
</details>
```
