          This site is as much for me as it is for you, it acts as a collection
          of thoughts, aha moments and tidbits of code which always seem to
          escape my little brain somehow. Have a cheeky gander and hit me up
          with anything... literally anything Iâ€™ve got time atm... (film
          recommendations, books and music are always encouraged).
